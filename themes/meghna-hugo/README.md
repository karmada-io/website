_Checkout this video tutorial_
<a href="https://youtu.be/ResipmZmpDU" target="_blank" title="meghna hugo installation" rel="nofollow"><img width="100%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37659754/103056582-88270880-45c7-11eb-9124-ab17bae951ec.png"></a>

In this tutorial, we will show you to make your website live without buying any hosting and touching a single line of code.

### What you need !!
1. Git account (Ex: GitHub, GitLab etc ). In our case, we use Github.
2. [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account to host files and add custom domain.
3. [Forestry](https://forestry.io) account to maintain whole project without code.

### Step 1 : Fork the repository
First we will fork this [Meghna Hugo](https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo) template.

### Step 2 : Add your repository in Forestry
Go to your [Forestry](https://forestry.io) account and click on `import your site now`.

**Or just click this button for import to forestry** [![import to forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestryK.svg)](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=themefisher/meghna-hugo&engine=hugo&version=0.60.1&config=exampleSite) **and 
declare your config.toml file from `exampleSite` directory and fill up basic settings.**

Now mark everything as done. Then go to configuration to change the base url. You can put any url but this have to be similar as netlify. So, for now, put a name which you are going to put in netlify as netlify subdomain.

### Step 3 : Setup and host website with Netlify
Here comes the last step . Go to your [netlify](https://netlify.com) account and click add new site . Choose your git repository to import your website in netlify .  And now you can see the forked `meghna hugo` theme. select it and follow the steps. Then go to `site settings` for change the site name. save it and go to `deploy` from top menu, Wait a while and click on `site preview` or just simply go to the subdomain you put as base url.

**Or just click this button to connect netlify** [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo)

**BOOM! Your site is live.** Now you can go to forestry and add, remove or customize every setting and content.
