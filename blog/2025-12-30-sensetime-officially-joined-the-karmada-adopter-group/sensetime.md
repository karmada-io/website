## About SenseTime

SenseTime adheres to the integrated strategy of "AI Infrastructure (SenseCore) –
Foundation Models (SenseNova) – Applications." SenseCore is SenseTime's
new-generation AI infrastructure designed for high efficiency, low cost, and
large-scale deployment. Focusing on the development, generation, and
application of large foundation models, SenseCore empowers innovative AI
production paradigms and, through co-optimization with model iteration, aims to
be the AI infrastructure that best understands large models.

In 2022, the SenseCore Artificial Intelligence Data Center (AIDC) in Shanghai
Lingang—a key asset of SenseCore—was officially put into operation, becoming
one of Asia's largest AI computing centers. Over the past three years,
SenseTime has continued to invest in and directly operate China's first
5A-level intelligent computing center, Shanghai Lingang AIDC. Through
operational innovation, the total computing power has reached 32,000 PFlops
(as of December 2025). This formidable capacity supports simultaneous training
for more than 20 ultra-large models with hundreds of billions of parameters,
and provides full lifecycle support for trillion-parameter foundation models.

As an industry pioneer, SenseCore has established an end-to-end, systematic
capability covering "Computing Power – Platform – Solution – Service." This not
only powers the rapid iteration of SenseTime's SenseNova foundation models, but
also quickly meets the innovative large model needs of clients across
industries, continuously enabling advances in AIGC, embodied intelligence,
AI4S, industrial intelligence, and related fields.
