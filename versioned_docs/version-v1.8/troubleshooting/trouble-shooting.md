## I can't access some resources when installing Karmada

- Pull images from Kubernetes Image Registry (registry.k8s.io).

  You can run the following commands to change the image registry in Mainland China.

  ```shell
  sed -i'' -e "s#registry.k8s.io#registry.aliyuncs.com/google_containers#g" artifacts/deploy/karmada-etcd.yaml
  sed -i'' -e "s#registry.k8s.io#registry.aliyuncs.com/google_containers#g" artifacts/deploy/karmada-apiserver.yaml
  sed -i'' -e "s#registry.k8s.io#registry.aliyuncs.com/google_containers#g" artifacts/deploy/kube-controller-manager.yaml
  ```

- Download the Golang package in Mainland China and run the following command before installation.

  ```shell
  export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn
  ```

## Member cluster healthy checking does not work
If your environment is similar to the following.
>
> After registering member cluster to karmada with push mode, and using `kubectl get cluster`, found the cluster status was ready.
> Then, by opening the firewall between the member cluster and karmada, after waiting for a long time, the cluster status was also ready, not change to fail.


The cause of the problem was that the firewall did not close the already existing TCP connection between the member cluster and karmada.

- login to the node where the member cluster apiserver is located
- use the `tcpkill` command to close the tcp connection.

```
# ens192 is the name of the network-card used by the member cluster to communicate with karmada.
tcpkill -9  -i ens192 src host ${KARMADA_APISERVER_IP} and dst port ${MEMBER_CLUTER_APISERVER_IP}
```

## x509: certificate signed by unknown authority issue when using `karmadactl init`

When using the `karmadactl init` command to install Karmada, `init` command raises the error log as follows:

```log
deploy.go:55] Post "https://192.168.24.211:32443/api/v1/namespaces": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "karmada")
```

Cause: Karmada has been installed on the cluster before. `karmada-etcd` uses the `hostpath` mode to mount the local storage. When `karmada-etcd` is uninstalled, residual data exists. We need to delete files in the defualt directory`/var/lib/karmada-etcd`. If the karmdactl  [--etcd-data](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/blob/master/pkg/karmadactl/cmdinit/cmdinit.go#L119) parameter is used, please delete the corresponding directory.

## karmada-webhook keeps on crashing due to "too many open files"

When using `hack/local-up-karmada` to install Karmada, karmada-webhook keeps on crashing raising the error log as follows:

```log

```

It's a resource exhaustion issue. You can fix it with:

```
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=16384
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=100000
```

## ServiceAccount deployed to the Karmada control-plane don't generate token

To improve token security and scalability, the Kubernetes community proposes [KEP-1205](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/1205-bound-service-account-tokens), which aims to introduce a new mechanism to use ServiceAccount tokens instead of directly mounting secrets generated by ServiceAccount to Pods. For details, see [ServiceAccount automation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#service-account-automation). This feature is called `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume`, which has GA in Kubernetes v1.22.

With the GA of the `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` feature, the Kubernetes community considers that it is unnecessary to automatically generate tokens for ServiceAccount because it is insecure. Therefore, [KEP-2799](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2799-reduction-of-secret-based-service-account-token) is proposed. One purpose of this KEP is not to automatically generate token secrets for ServiceAccount, and the other purpose is to clear token secrets generated by unused ServiceAccounts.

For the first purpose, the Kubernetes provides the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate, which has entered the Beta phase in Kubernetes v1.24. This is why the Karmada control-plane cannot generate tokens, because `karmada-apiserver` v1.24 is used in Karmada. If you still want to use the previous method to generate a token secret for ServiceAccount, you can refer to this [section](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#manually-create-an-api-token-for-a-serviceaccount).
