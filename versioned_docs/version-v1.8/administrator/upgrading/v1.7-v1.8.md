title: v1.7 to v1.8

Follow the [Regular Upgrading Process](./README.md).

## Upgrading Notable Changes

### API Changes

* Introduced `ServiceProvisionClusters` and `ServiceConsumptionClusters` which will be used to specify service source and consumption place.

### karmada-controller-manager

* Introduced hpaReplicasSyncer controller which syncs workload's replicas from the member cluster to the control plane.
  In new version, the `currentReplicas` and `desiredReplicas` in the status of HPA will be aggregated to the ResourceTemplate by default 
  and the `replicas` of ResourceTemplate would be automatically retained if it is scaling with an HPA.

### karmada-aggregated-apiserver

* Add ca to check the validation of the member clusters' server certificate.

Please refer to [v1.8.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/releases/tag/v1.8.0) for more details.
