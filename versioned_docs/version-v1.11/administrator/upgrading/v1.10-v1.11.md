* `ResourceInterpreterCustomization`: Added two additional printer columns, TARGET-API-VERSION and TARGET-KIND, to represent the target resource type, these columns will be displayed in the output of kubectl get.
* `PropagationPolicy`/`ClusterPropagationPolicy`: Added two additional printer columns, `Conflict-Resolution` and `Priority`, to represent the conflict resolution strategy and priority, these columns will be displayed in the output of kubectl get.

    * propagationpolicy.karmada.io/namespace
