Follow the [Regular Upgrading Process](./README.md).

## Upgrading Notable Changes

### API Changes

- Introduced `Components` field to `ResourceInterpreterContext` in the `ResourceInterpreterResponse` to support the `InterpretComponent` operation for webhook interpreters.
- `karmada-operator`: Introduced a `PodDisruptionBudget` field to the `CommonSettings` of `Karmada` API for supporting PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) for Karmada control plane components.

### Deprecation

- `karmada-operator`: Deprecated external etcd fields `CAData`, `CertData`, and `KeyData` have been removed. Use `ExternalEtcd.SecretRef` to provide client connection credentials instead.
- `karmadactl`: The flag `--etcd-init-image` of command `init` has been marked deprecated because it is no longer used, and will be removed in the future release.

### Dependencies

- Karmada is now built with Golang v1.24.10.
- Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.34.1.
- Updated `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` from v0.21.0 to v0.22.4.
- The base image `alpine` has been promoted from 3.22.1 to 3.22.2.
