title: karmada-agent
---



### Synopsis

The karmada-agent is the agent of member clusters. It can register a specific cluster to the Karmada control
plane and sync manifests from the Karmada control plane to the member cluster. In addition, it also syncs the status of member 
cluster and manifests to the Karmada control plane.

### Options

```
      --add_dir_header                                 If true, adds the file directory to the header of the log messages
