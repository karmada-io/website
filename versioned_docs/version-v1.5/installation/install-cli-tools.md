## Install Karmadactl

You can install `karmadactl` in any of the following ways:

- One-click installation.
- Build from source code.

### One-click installation

Karmada provides `karmadactl` download service since v1.2.0. You can choose the proper version which fits your operator system form [karmada release](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/releases).

To install the latest release run:

```shell
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmada-io/karmada/master/hack/install-cli.sh | sudo bash
```

The install script does the following:

- attempts to detect your OS
- downloads and unpacks the release tar file in a temporary directory
- copies the karmadactl binary to /usr/local/bin
- removes the temporary directory

Also, you can export `INSTALL_CLI_VERSION` env to select the version you want to install.

For example, use the following command to install the 1.3.0 karmadactl:

```shell
export INSTALL_CLI_VERSION=1.3.0
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmada-io/karmada/master/hack/install-cli.sh | sudo bash
```

:::note

install-cli.sh only supports CLI tools after 1.2.0.
