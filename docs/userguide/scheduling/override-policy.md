title: Override Policy
---

The [OverridePolicy][1] and [ClusterOverridePolicy][2] are used to define override rules for resources when 
they are being propagated to different clusters.

## Difference between OverridePolicy and ClusterOverridePolicy
ClusterOverridePolicy represents the cluster-wide policy that overrides a group of resources to one or more clusters while OverridePolicy will apply to resources in the same namespace as the namespace-wide policy. For cluster-scoped resources, apply ClusterOverridePolicy by policies name in ascending order. For namespaced scoped resources, ClusterOverridePolicy is applied first, followed by OverridePolicy.

## Resource Selector

ResourceSelectors restrict resource types that the override policy applies to. If you ignore this field, it matches all resources.

Resource Selector requires the `apiVersion` field which represents the API version of the target resources and `kind` which represents the kind of the target resources. 
The allowed selectors are as follows:
- `namespace`: namespace of the target resource.
- `name`: name of the target resource.
- `labelSelector`: a label query over a set of resources.

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: nginx
      namespace: test
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
  overrideRules:
  #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to the `Deployment` named nginx in test namespace and has the `app: nginx` label.

## Target Cluster

Target Cluster defines restrictions on the override policy that only apply to resources propagated to the matching clusters. If you ignore this field it matches all clusters.

The allowed selectors are as follows:
- `labelSelector`: a filter to select member clusters by labels.
- `fieldSelector`: a filter to select member clusters by fields. Currently only three fields of provider(cluster.spec.provider), zone(cluster.spec.zone), and region(cluster.spec.region) are supported.
- `clusterNames`: the list of clusters to be selected.
- `exclude`: the list of clusters to be ignored.

### labelSelector

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - targetCluster:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            cluster: member1 
      overriders:
      #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to resources propagated to clusters which have the `cluster: member1` label.

### fieldSelector

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - targetCluster:
        fieldSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: region
              operator: In
              values:
                - cn-north-1
      overriders:
      #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to resources propagated to clusters which have the `spec.region` field with values in [cn-north-1].

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - targetCluster:
        fieldSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: provider
              operator: In
              values:
                - aws
      overriders:
      #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to resources propagated to clusters which have the `spec.provider` field with values in [aws].

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - targetCluster:
        fieldSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: zone
              operator: In
              values:
                - us
      overriders:
      #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to resources propagated to clusters which have the `spec.zone` field with values in [us].

### clusterNames

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - targetCluster:
        clusterNames:
          - member1
      overriders:
      #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to resources propagated to clusters whose clusterNames are member1.

### exclude

#### Examples
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - targetCluster:
        exclude:
          - member1
      overriders:
      #...
```
Override rules above will only be applied to resources propagated to clusters whose clusterNames are not member1.

## Overriders

Karmada offers various alternatives to declare the override rules:
- `ImageOverrider`: overrides images for workloads.
- `CommandOverrider`: overrides commands for workloads.
- `ArgsOverrider`: overrides args for workloads.
- `LabelsOverrider`: overrides labels for workloads.
- `AnnotationsOverrider`: overrides annotations for workloads.
- `PlaintextOverrider`: a general-purpose tool to override any kind of resources.
- `FieldOverrider`: partially override values inside JSON and YAML fields.

### ImageOverrider
The `ImageOverrider` is a refined tool to override images with format `[registry/]repository[:tag|@digest]`(e.g.`/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image`) for workloads such as `Deployment`.

The allowed operations are as follows:
- `add`: appends the registry, repository or tag/digest to the image from containers.
- `remove`: removes the registry, repository or tag/digest from the image from containers. 
- `replace`: replaces the registry, repository or tag/digest of the image from containers.

#### Examples
Suppose we create a deployment named `myapp`.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  #...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: myapp:1.0.0
          name: myapp
```

**Example 1: add the registry when propagating workloads to specific clusters.**
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        imageOverrider:
          - component: Registry
            operator: add
            value: test-repo
```
This will `add` a `test-repo` registry to the image of `myapp`.

After the policy is applied for `myapp`, the image will be:
```yaml
      containers:
        - image: test-repo/myapp:1.0.0
          name: myapp
```

**Example 2: replace the repository when propagating workloads to specific clusters.**
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        imageOverrider:
          - component: Repository
            operator: replace
            value: myapp2
```
This will `replace` the `myapp` repo with `myapp2` on the image.

After the policy is applied for `myapp`, the image will be:
```yaml
      containers:
        - image: myapp2:1.0.0
          name: myapp
```

**Example 3: remove the tag when propagating workloads to specific clusters.**
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        imageOverrider:
          - component: Tag
            operator: remove
```
This will `remove` the `myapp` image's tag.

After the policy is applied for `myapp`, the image will be:
```yaml
      containers:
        - image: myapp
          name: myapp
```

### CommandOverrider
The `CommandOverrider` is a refined tool to override commands(e.g.`/spec/template/spec/containers/0/command`) 
for workloads, such as `Deployments`.

The allowed operations are as follows:
- `add`: appends one or more flags to the command list.
- `remove`: removes one or more flags from the command list.

#### Examples
Suppose we create a deployment named `myapp`.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  #...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: myapp
          name: myapp
          command:
            - ./myapp
            - --parameter1=foo
            - --parameter2=bar
```

**Example 1: add flags when propagating workloads to specific clusters.**
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        commandOverrider:
          - containerName: myapp
            operator: add
            value:
              - --cluster=member1
```
This will `add` (append) a new flag `--cluster=member1` to `myapp` command.

After the policy is applied for `myapp`, the command list will be:
```yaml
      containers:
        - image: myapp
          name: myapp
          command:
            - ./myapp
            - --parameter1=foo
            - --parameter2=bar
            - --cluster=member1
```

**Example 2: remove flags when propagating workloads to specific clusters.**
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        commandOverrider:
          - containerName: myapp
            operator: remove
            value:
              - --parameter1=foo
```
This will `remove` the flag `--parameter1=foo` from the command list.

After the policy is applied for `myapp`, the `command` list will be:
```yaml
      containers:
        - image: myapp
          name: myapp
          command:
            - ./myapp
            - --parameter2=bar
```

### ArgsOverrider
The `ArgsOverrider` is a refined tool to override args(such as `/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args`) for workloads,
such as `Deployments`.

The allowed operations are as follows:
- `add`: appends one or more args to the command list.
- `remove`: removes one or more args from the command list.

Note: `ArgsOverrider` functions similarly to `CommandOverrider`. You can refer to the `CommandOverrider` examples.


### LabelsOverrider

The allowed operations are as follows:
- `add`: the items in `value` will be appended to labels.
- `remove`: if the item in `value` matches the item in labels, the former will be deleted. If they do not match, nothing will be done.
- `replace`: if the key in `value` matches the key in the label, the former will be replaced. If they do not match, nothing will be done.

#### Examples
Suppose we create a deployment named `myapp`.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels: 
    foo: foo
    baz: baz
  #...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: myapp:1.0.0
          name: myapp
```

**Example 1: add/remove/replace labels **
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        labelsOverrider:
          - operator: add
            value: 
              bar: bar  # It will be added to labels
          - operator: replace
            value: 
              foo: exist # "foo: foo" will be replaced by "foo: exist"
          - operator: remove
            value: 
              baz: baz   # It will be removed from labels
```

### AnnotationsOverrider

Note: `AnnotationsOverrider` functions similarly to `LabelsOverrider`. You can refer to the `LabelsOverrider` examples.


### FieldOverrider
The `FieldOverrider` allows users to partially override values inside  JSON and YAML fields. 

The allowed operations are as follows:

+ `add`: appends new key-value pairs at the specified sub path.
+ `remove`: removes specific key-value pairs at the specified sub path.
+ `replace`: replaces existing values with new values at the specified sub path.

Suppose we have a ConfigMap named myconfigmap that contains some nested YAML data:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
data:
  config.yaml: |
    app:
      database:
        port: 5432
```

**Example 1: replace the database port within the ConfigMap using YAML Patch operations.**

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        fieldOverrider:
          - fieldPath: /data/config.yaml
            yaml:
              - subPath: /app/database/port
                operator: replace
                value: "3306"
```
After applying this OverridePolicy, the ConfigMap will be updated as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
data:
  config.yaml: |
    app:
      database:
        port: 3306
```

### PlaintextOverrider
The `PlaintextOverrider` is a simple overrider that overrides target fields according to path, operator and value, just like `kubectl patch`.

The allowed operations are as follows:
- `add`: appends one or more elements to the resources.
- `remove`: removes one or more elements from the resources.
- `replace`: replaces one or more elements from the resources.

Suppose we create a configmap named `myconfigmap`.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
  #...
data:
  example: 1
```

**Example 1: replace configmap data when propagating resources to specific clusters.**
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.karmada.io/v1alpha1
kind: OverridePolicy
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  #...
  overrideRules:
    - overriders:
        plaintext:
          - path: /data/example
            operator: replace
            value: 2
```
This will `replace` data of the configmap from `example: 1` to `example: 2`.

After the policy is applied for `myconfigmap`, the configmap will be:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
  #...
data:
  example: 2
```
