  - **resource.namespace** (string)

    Namespace represents the namespace for the referent. For non-namespace scoped resources(e.g. 'ClusterRole')ï¼Œdo not need specify Namespace, and for namespace scoped resources, Namespace is required. If Namespace is not specified, means the resource is non-namespace scoped.

  - **resource.resourceVersion** (string)

    ResourceVersion represents the internal version of the referenced object, that can be used by clients to determine when object has changed.

  - **resource.uid** (string)

    UID of the referent.

  ConflictResolution declares how potential conflict should be handled when a resource that is being propagated already exists in the target cluster.
  
  It defaults to "Abort" which means stop propagating to avoid unexpected overwrites. The "Overwrite" might be useful when migrating legacy cluster resources to Karmada, in which case conflict is predictable and can be instructed to Karmada take over the resource by overwriting.

- **failover** (FailoverBehavior)

  Failover indicates how Karmada migrates applications in case of failures. It inherits directly from the associated PropagationPolicy(or ClusterPropagationPolicy).

  <a name="FailoverBehavior"></a>

  *FailoverBehavior indicates failover behaviors in case of an application or cluster failure.*

  - **failover.application** (ApplicationFailoverBehavior)

    Application indicates failover behaviors in case of application failure. If this value is nil, failover is disabled. If set, the PropagateDeps should be true so that the dependencies could be migrated along with the application.

      PurgeMode represents how to deal with the legacy applications on the cluster from which the application is migrated. Valid options are "Immediately", "Graciously" and "Never". Defaults to "Graciously".

- **gracefulEvictionTasks** ([]GracefulEvictionTask)

  GracefulEvictionTasks holds the eviction tasks that are expected to perform the eviction in a graceful way. The intended workflow is: 1. Once the controller(such as 'taint-manager') decided to evict the resource that
     is referenced by current ResourceBinding or ClusterResourceBinding from a target
     cluster, it removes(or scale down the replicas) the target from Clusters(.spec.Clusters)
     and builds a graceful eviction task.
  2. The scheduler may perform a re-scheduler and probably select a substitute cluster
     to take over the evicting workload(resource).
  3. The graceful eviction controller takes care of the graceful eviction tasks and
     performs the final removal after the workload(resource) is available on the substitute
     cluster or exceed the grace termination period(defaults to 10 minutes).

  - **gracefulEvictionTasks.creationTimestamp** (Time)

    CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. Clients should not set this value to avoid the time inconsistency issue. It is represented in RFC3339 form(like '2021-04-25T10:02:10Z') and is in UTC.
    
    Populated by the system. Read-only.

    <a name="Time"></a>

    *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

  - **gracefulEvictionTasks.gracePeriodSeconds** (int32)

    GracePeriodSeconds is the maximum waiting duration in seconds before the item should be deleted.

  - **placement.clusterAffinities** ([]ClusterAffinityTerm)

    ClusterAffinities represents scheduling restrictions to multiple cluster groups that indicated by ClusterAffinityTerm.
    
    The scheduler will evaluate these groups one by one in the order they appear in the spec, the group that does not satisfy scheduling restrictions will be ignored which means all clusters in this group will not be selected unless it also belongs to the next group(a cluster could belong to multiple groups).
    
    If none of the groups satisfy the scheduling restrictions, then scheduling fails, which means no cluster will be selected.
    
    Note:
      1. ClusterAffinities can not co-exist with ClusterAffinity.
      2. If both ClusterAffinity and ClusterAffinities are not set, any cluster
         can be scheduling candidates.
    
    Potential use case 1: The private clusters in the local data center could be the main group, and the managed clusters provided by cluster providers could be the secondary group. So that the Karmada scheduler would prefer to schedule workloads to the main group and the second group will only be considered in case of the main group does not satisfy restrictions(like, lack of resources).
    
    Potential use case 2: For the disaster recovery scenario, the clusters could be organized to primary and backup groups, the workloads would be scheduled to primary clusters firstly, and when primary cluster fails(like data center power off), Karmada scheduler could migrate workloads to the backup clusters.

    *RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.
    
    To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also need to register your various plugin types.
    
    // Internal package:
    
    	type MyAPIObject struct [
    		runtime.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
    		MyPlugin runtime.Object `json:"myPlugin"`
    	]
    
    	type PluginA struct [
    		AOption string `json:"aOption"`
    	]
    
    // External package:
    
    	type MyAPIObject struct [
    		runtime.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
    		MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension `json:"myPlugin"`
    	]
    
    	type PluginA struct [
    		AOption string `json:"aOption"`
    	]
    
    // On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
    
    	[
    		"kind":"MyAPIObject",
    		"apiVersion":"v1",
    		"myPlugin": [
    			"kind":"PluginA",
    			"aOption":"foo",
    		],
    	]
    
    So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)*

- **conditions** ([]Condition)

  Conditions contain the different condition statuses.

  <a name="Condition"></a>

  *Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.*

  - **conditions.lastTransitionTime** (Time), required

    lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

    <a name="Time"></a>

    *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

  - **conditions.message** (string), required

    message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.

  - **conditions.reason** (string), required

    reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.

  - **conditions.status** (string), required

    status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

  - **conditions.type** (string), required

    type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.

  - **conditions.observedGeneration** (int64)

    observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

- **lastScheduledTime** (Time)

  LastScheduledTime representing the latest timestamp when scheduler successfully finished a scheduling. It is represented in RFC3339 form (like '2006-01-02T15:04:05Z') and is in UTC.

  <a name="Time"></a>

  *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

- **schedulerObservedGeneration** (int64)

  SchedulerObservedGeneration is the generation(.metadata.generation) observed by the scheduler. If SchedulerObservedGeneration is less than the generation in metadata means the scheduler hasn't confirmed the scheduling result or hasn't done the schedule yet.

- **schedulerObservingAffinityName** (string)

  SchedulerObservedAffinityName is the name of affinity term that is the basis of current scheduling.
